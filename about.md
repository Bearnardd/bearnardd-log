Hello there!

I go by the nickname Bearnardd. I'm an ML Engineer deeply passionate about the immense potential of machine learning. Over the past four years, I've immersed myself in a diverse range of projects, spanning from ML compilers to NLP Research. My primary motivation is to leverage AI for positive societal and environmental impact. Currently, I'm heavily involved in transformer-based architectures, focusing on planning, extending contextual understanding, and optimizing inference speeds.

Alongside, I've actively contributed to open-source initiatives, resolving complex bugs, and pioneering innovative concepts. However, my interests extend further. I have a deep commitment to exploring distributed training methods, for more efficient learning and inference. Moreover, I'm fascinated by ML system design, fast ML serving, fine-tuning, complex prompt techniques, and the pathway to AGI. On a different note, I have a profound interest in everything related to rockets, planets, astrophysics, and the universe.

Let's journey through the AI landscape together (and maybe delve into some physics/rocket-related discussions), paving the way for impactful advancements while advocating for sustainability in the evolution of technology.
